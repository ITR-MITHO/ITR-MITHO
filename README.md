### PowerShell for Microsoft Exchange and Active Directory automation  
The idea of my scripts is to have tools available that can be run without editing anything at all.

- If the scripts have prerequisites (Run as admin and such) it will be written inside of the script as a comment
- All scripts can be run as oneliners with: cmd /c "powershell iex (irm raw.githubusercontent.com/ITR-MITHO/Myscript.ps1)"

Newly developed scripts will be uploaded as soon as it have completed the testing phase.
